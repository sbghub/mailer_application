# mailer_application
An application for sending emails


# Goal:

Write an application that uses the outlined technologies to create mailing lists. These lists can be as short or long as the user desires and should be named such that they can be pulled up later. 

For example, I should be able to make a list called “Durham” and place Friese, Aundrey, and myself on that list. Later if I want to send an e-mail to that list, it should be available in a dropdown to select from. 

Finally, there should be a place to type an e-mail out and send it out to the desired mailing list.

Styling, layout, and other aesthetic features is up to the developers. All should be deployed within Docker, but as a local instance so no need for apache or Nginx
